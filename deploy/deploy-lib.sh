# shellcheck shell=bash
# deploy-lib.sh: shared homelab docker compose deploy with a real health gate
# and automatic rollback. Canonical source: drench44/ci-shared deploy/deploy-lib.sh
DL_LIB_VERSION="2.2.1"
#
# Most repos should not source this directly: write a small config file and
# run deploy/homelab-deploy <config> (see deploy/example.deploy.conf).
#
# Why it exists: a health endpoint that always says "ok" hides a broken
# deploy. On 2026-09-17 a deploy deleted a box's .env, the app still answered
# /health with ok, and a card silently vanished for a day. So this library
# refuses to run with a shallow health check: the config must name fields the
# health response has to carry (DL_HEALTH_REQUIRE) and/or a timestamp that
# must be recent (DL_HEALTH_FRESH), and it can require files and env values on
# the box before anything restarts (DL_REQUIRE_FILES, DL_REQUIRE_ENV).
#
# What one deploy does (dl_run):
#   1. Preflight: settings complete, tools present, git tree clean, health
#      gate not shallow.
#   2. Rollback point: tag each service's running image
#      <image>:pre-<UTC time>-<sha> (<image> = that service's own image:,
#      or <project>-<service> when it only has build:; <sha> = the commit
#      being deployed; after a healthy deploy the newest DL_SNAPSHOT_KEEP
#      such tags per image are kept), snapshot the compose directory
#      to a tarball on the box, and create + push git tag
#      rollback-point/<service>/<UTC time> on the commit that was running
#      (read from the box's state file). Git now records what to go back to.
#   3. dl_sync, if the config defines it (for example rsync the repo to the box).
#   4. Required files and env values on the box. Missing: restore the
#      snapshot and stop before anything restarts.
#   5. docker compose up -d --build.
#   6. Poll the health URL until every requirement holds (and dl_health_extra,
#      if the config defines it, passes), or time out; after DL_HEALTH_SETTLE
#      seconds check once more.
#   7. Healthy: record the new commit in the box state file, create + push
#      git tag deploy/<service>/<UTC time>-<sha>.
#      Not healthy: restore the snapshot, retag the pre- image back onto
#      the compose image name, recreate without building, judge the old
#      version again (see "Judging a rollback"), and create + push git tag
#      failed-deploy/<service>/<time>-<sha>.
#   Every outcome is also appended to deploys.log in the box state dir, so
#   the box keeps the record even where git tags stay local (DL_TAG_PUSH).
#
# Judging a rollback. Before anything changes, the version running now is
# probed with the full gate. A rollback is then judged by what THAT version
# proved, never by more:
#   - it passed the full gate: the rollback must pass the full gate again
#     (the commit check uses the box's deployed-commit record);
#   - it did not (a version from before the gate, a deploy record it never
#     had, a source already down): the rollback must answer liveness
#     (DL_LIVENESS_URL), plus dl_health_extra if that passed before too.
#   The log says which gate judged it. SERVICE IS DOWN is printed only when
#   liveness itself does not answer after the rollback.
#   (2026-09-23: the first real family-hub deploy rolled back a hub with no
#   deploy record, judged it by the new gate it could never pass, waited
#   330 s and printed SERVICE IS DOWN while the wall was up and serving.)
#
# Exit codes of dl_run:
#   0  deployed, healthy, tags pushed
#   1  deploy was unhealthy (or dl_sync failed), rolled back, and the old
#      version passes what it passed before the deploy
#   2  DOWN: after the rollback (or with nothing to roll back to) liveness
#      does not answer
#   3  config or precondition problem; nothing was restarted (box files restored)
#   4  deployed and healthy, but a git tag could not be created or pushed
#   5  up but not as intended: the service answers liveness, but the rollback
#      is incomplete (a service had no rollback point, the files could not be
#      put back) or the old version fails a check it passed before the deploy
#   6  nothing restarted, but dl_sync's files could not be taken back off the
#      box: the running containers are fine, the NEXT restart is not. Put the
#      files back by hand (the message says how) before anything restarts.
#
# Settings:
#   DL_SERVICE          required. Name used in tags, state and messages.
#   DL_COMPOSE_DIR      required. Directory with the compose file (on DL_REMOTE if set).
#   DL_REMOTE           ssh host that runs docker. Empty = local docker.
#   DL_SERVICES         compose services to deploy and roll back. Empty = all.
#   DL_COMPOSE_ARGS     extra args after "docker compose", e.g. "-f prod.yml -p hub".
#   DL_UP_ARGS          default "up -d --build".
#   DL_HEALTH_URL       required. URL polled after the deploy.
#   DL_HEALTH_REQUIRE   jq paths (space or newline separated) that must be present
#                       and truthy in the JSON response, e.g.
#                       ".integrations.home_assistant.ok .laundry.washer".
#   DL_HEALTH_FRESH     "<jq path> <max age seconds>" lines: a timestamp (ISO 8601
#                       with Z or an offset, or epoch seconds/ms) that must be at
#                       most that old, e.g. ".weather.observed_at 5400".
#   DL_HEALTH_JQ        optional extra jq predicate; every value it yields must be
#                       true, and it must yield at least one.
#   DL_HEALTH_COMMIT    optional jq path to the commit the app reports it runs;
#                       it must match the deployed commit (full or short sha).
#                       The only proof the NEW version answered; set it if the
#                       app can report its commit.
#   DL_HEALTH_PROBLEMS  jq path to the app's own list of problems, added to a
#                       failed check's reason. Default .problems; absent = nothing.
#   DL_HEALTH_SETTLE    seconds to wait after the first healthy answer, then
#                       check again (catches crash loops). Default 10.
#   DL_HEALTH_SHALLOW_OK=1  allow a gate with none of the three above (not advised).
#   DL_HEALTH_FROM      "local" (curl here, default) or "remote" (curl on DL_REMOTE,
#                       for services bound to the box's loopback only).
#   DL_LIVENESS_URL     URL that answers 2xx whenever the process is up (for
#                       example /health), the least a rolled-back version must
#                       prove. Default: DL_HEALTH_URL answering 2xx at all.
#                       Fetched the same way as DL_HEALTH_URL (DL_HEALTH_FROM).
#   DL_PRE_PROBE_TRIES  tries of the full gate on the version running before the
#                       deploy (DL_HEALTH_INTERVAL apart) before a rollback to
#                       it is judged by liveness instead. Default 3.
#   DL_HEALTH_TIMEOUT   seconds to wait for healthy. Default 120.
#   DL_HEALTH_INTERVAL  seconds between polls. Default 5.
#   DL_REQUIRE_FILES    files (relative to DL_COMPOSE_DIR) that must exist and be
#                       non-empty on the box before restarting, e.g. ".env config.json".
#   DL_REQUIRE_ENV      "file:VAR" items: VAR must have a non-empty value in that
#                       env file on the box, e.g. ".env:HA_TOKEN".
#   DL_SNAPSHOT         1 (default) = tar the compose dir before dl_sync and restore
#                       it on rollback. Files dl_sync ADDS are left in place.
#   DL_SNAPSHOT_EXCLUDE paths (tar --exclude patterns) left out of the snapshot,
#                       e.g. "./data ./photos". Keep big data out.
#   DL_SNAPSHOT_KEEP    snapshots kept per service, and pre-<stamp>-<sha> image
#                       tags kept per image repo (pruned after a healthy
#                       deploy). Default 5.
#   DL_STATE_DIR        state dir on the box. Default
#                       $HOME/.local/state/homelab-deploy/<service> (box's $HOME).
#   DL_GIT_DIR          repo being deployed. Default: current directory.
#   DL_SHA              optional; if set it must equal HEAD (the checkout is what ships).
#   DL_GIT_REMOTE       where tags are pushed. Default origin.
#   DL_TAG_PUSH         1 = create and push git tags (default); local = record
#                       them in DL_GIT_DIR as refs/deploy-history/<name>, not
#                       as tags (a release's --follow-tags push would publish
#                       tags), never pushed; 0 = no tags.
#                       Pushing is refused (exit 3 before anything changes)
#                       unless the remote is known to be private: a GitHub
#                       remote is asked (gh api) and must be private; a local
#                       path or file:// URL counts as private; any other host
#                       needs DL_TAG_REMOTE_PRIVATE=1. A deploy history does
#                       not belong in a public repo, so a public repo's config
#                       sets DL_TAG_PUSH=local (or, only when that is really
#                       intended, DL_TAG_PUSH_PUBLIC=1). Every push URL of the
#                       remote is checked (pushurl, pushInsteadOf), and only
#                       a deploy checks (--health makes no tags).
#   DL_TAG_PUSH_PUBLIC=1    allow pushing tags to a PUBLIC remote (not advised).
#   DL_TAG_REMOTE_PRIVATE=1 the remote is private but not on GitHub.
#   DL_ALLOW_DIRTY      1 = allow deploying with uncommitted changes. Default 0.
# Hooks:
#   dl_sync             optional shell function, run after the rollback point is
#                       recorded and before the restart. Non-zero = roll back files.
#   dl_health_extra     optional shell function, a check the JSON cannot make (a
#                       headless page load over the LAN, the ports a container
#                       publishes). Runs in a subshell on every probe, only after
#                       the JSON requirements hold, with the response body as $1
#                       and DL_FULL_SHA set to the commit being judged (empty for
#                       --health). Non-zero = unhealthy; its last output lines are
#                       the reason. It must bound its own run time (ssh
#                       ConnectTimeout, timeout -k): the poll waits for it. It
#                       adds to the gate, it never replaces it: a config with
#                       only this hook is still refused as shallow. When the
#                       version running before a deploy fails the JSON gate,
#                       the hook is run on its own (with $1 empty) to learn
#                       whether a rollback to that version must pass it.
